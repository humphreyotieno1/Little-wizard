# Making the Script Executable and Running It

To run the `results_script.sh` file, you first need to make it executable. Follow these steps in your terminal:

1. **Make the script executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x results_script.sh
   ```

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   ./results_script.sh
   ```

If you see a "Permission denied" error, double-check that you ran the `chmod +x` command and that you are in the correct directory.
